Abstract: Mature urban tree canopy cover disrupts local effects of urban heat islands and
provides ecosystem services such as energy savings through direct and indirect
shading, pollution removal, storm runoff control, and carbon sequestration. This study
addresses the gap in research regarding the value of energy savings provided by
juvenile trees, how that value changes considering predicted tree growth and mortality
by 2050, as well as the spatial distribution of ecosystem services. Using i-Tree Eco
software, this study models the current and future ecosystem services provided to
residents based on a juvenile tree inventory of 2,271 street and residential trees
planted from 2014 through 2015 by the Greening the Gateway Cities Program (GGCP)
in Chicopee and Fall River, MA. Juvenile trees planted by the DCR provided $775 and
$1,512 (2018) in annual ecosystem service savings in Chicopee and Fall River while
GGCP Trees modeled to mature conditions show exponentially increased total annual
savings of $2,294 and $4,401 in Chicopee and Fall River (2050). A minimum of two to
three trees per acre are required to reach maturity in ecosystem provisioning. Results
of this study reinforce the importance of tree survivorship on sustaining the urban tree
canopy to provide ecosystem services.
